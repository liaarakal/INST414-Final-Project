# INST414-Final-Project
Code written for my final project for Data Science Techniques (INST414)

This project is a comprehensive analysis of two different approaches to criminal justice risk assessment, comparing the effectiveness of prediction models for any re-arrest versus felony re-arrest. It evaluates different intervention strategies using ML models to inform evidence-based policy decisions.
