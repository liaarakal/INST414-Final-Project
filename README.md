# INST414-Final-Project
Code written for my final project for Data Science Techniques (INST414)

This project is a comprehensive analysis of two different approaches to criminal justice risk assessment, comparing the effectiveness of prediction models for any re-arrest versus felony re-arrest. It evaluates different intervention strategies using ML models to inform evidence-based policy decisions.

## Technical Implementation
- Built and compared Decision Tree and Random Forest models
- Feature engineering focused on criminal history patterns
- Model evaluation using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Implemented threshold-based classification for intervention assignment
- Detailed cost-benefit analysis of different intervention strategies

## Key Features
- Criminal history feature generation
- Risk prediction model development
- Fairness analysis across demographic groups
- Cost-benefit analysis of interventions
- Model performance evaluation using:
--Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
-- False Positive Rate (FPR)
-- ROC AUC scoring

## Data Analysis
Analyzes multiple aspects of criminal justice data:
- Historical arrest records
- Charge severity patterns
- Weapon involvement
- Re-arrest outcomes
- Demographic group impacts

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
